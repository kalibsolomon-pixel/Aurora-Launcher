# UI polish review, round 47

Frozen, unedited native GPUI captures using isolated disposable sample data,
taken with the same procedure, window size (1402 x 951 physical pixels at 125%
Windows scaling) and imported skin fixture as round 22.

Changes since round 46:

- Content places category navigation above the list and groups filter,
  acquisition and management controls in one toolbar.
- Discover retains five complete rows while giving descriptions two lines.
- Account removal is a quiet text action; recovery remains a bounded button.
- The off-state Sync summary uses static bullets for saved choices.
- A fresh isolated fixture was used for real installation checks; Downloads
  records the resulting session's finished installs.

Supplementary captures cover the same interaction states as round 22 (Discover
paging and details, Content management/import/updates/removal review, Home
customization, Sync draft and Revert while off, Instance/Settings/Sync sections,
custom accent preview, skin preview controls and the smaller window sizes).

## Validation and limits

Native debug build; 385 tests passed; Rust formatting and whitespace checks passed. Captures were driven through UI
Automation against the disposable showcase root only; no content was removed,
no Sync change applied and no sign-in attempted. Before capture, Entity Culling,
Cloth Config API and FerriteCore were installed from Discover into the disposable Survival
Plus instance so Downloads and Content show real results, and the
disposable root carries a saved (off) Sync policy with two participating
instances; and the exact
disposable process was stopped afterwards. `screenshots-sha256.json` records
every PNG. Earlier frozen screenshot hashes were verified unchanged. Full keyboard/text-editing accessibility, the native file picker and
performance remain unverified, as in round 22.

The council criterion stays open until every participating blind reviewer
scores the nine main screens overall >= 9/10. Reviewers receive only the nine
PNG paths and the rubric.
